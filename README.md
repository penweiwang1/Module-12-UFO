## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to create multiple filters using javascript in order to increase the function of the website, such that the user can input multiple criteras and sort though the results. 

## Results:

As shown in the image above, the user is presented with all of the UFO sightings data. To perform a search, the user can filter under the following categories: date, city, state, country, and shape. After entering the desired input in the correlating categories, the user can just press "Enter" on their keyboard and the filtered results should automatically appear. It can be seen in the image below that after the imput of the date "1/2/2010" under the "Enter Date" filter box, the output of data only displayed the UFO sightings of 1/2/2010.

The data can be futher filtered by inputing another critera. For example, after filtering by the date of 1/2/2010, the results from the search can be narrowed down even more by restricting the results to just the state of California. See  image below

## Summary:
One drawback of this webpage is that it is very limited in its function as it can only filter the results through the limited 5 criterias. In addition, it cannot filter two inputs of the same category (i.e. two different dates).

To improve the webpage and user experience, further development will allow users to filter multiple inputs of the same category and for it to work even if the input characters are capitalized or not. The website can also be improved by including an interactive map that can pinpoint the city and list all the related sightings in order to provide a better visual for the user.
